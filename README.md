#### This is a repository  for Lab and HW code in Multilevel Models/HLM - PLS 900 Michigan State University

Problems largely come from Gelman and Hill (2007) book, "Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models." Some code is referenced from various, open sources. 

All errors are my own.
